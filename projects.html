            <h2>Thesis: 3D Hybrid Model for New Product Development</h2>
            <p>A structured model that is based on the ideas of Suh’s axiomatic design, Barry Boehm’s Spiral model and Robert Cooper’s Stage-Gate process, which aims to address all the stages of a New Product Development process to eliminate some or most of the bottlenecks and limitations present in the current NPD processes.</p>
            <h2> Society of Manufcturing Engineering Club</h2>
            <p> Over 2 academic years, the SME team at RIT worked on developing a prototype chocolate manufacturing cell. The main goal of this project was to educate and create excitement about STEM in High School students. A curriculum was planned around the working of the cell, which would act as a visual aid for the students to understand STEM concepts better. The cell had Adept SCARA robot in integration with Allen-Bradley PLC and proximity sensors. I was involved in designing the cell layout, integrating the Adept and PLC, and programming the PLC.</p>
            <h2> S'mores 2.0</h2>
            <p>S'mores 2.0 was the capstone team project for the undergraduates of class of 2016. This cell was completely automated and produced s'mores. The cell had Fanuc LR Mate 200i in integration with Allen-Bradley PLC and multiple proximity sensors. As a part of my Teaching Assistant position, I assisted the undergraduates with planning, integrating workcells, and PLC programming.</p>
