<h1> Survey Introduction </h1>
<p>
My name is Nataraj Munoli and I am a graduate student at Rochester Institute of Technology. As a part of my graduate thesis, I have developed a model for New Product Development process; 3D Hybrid Model. My review of current New Product Development models indicates that most companies follow a unique Product Development Process which is tailored specifically to what works for the company, and these models are variations of either Cooper’s Stage Gate Method, Suh’s Axiomatic design theory, Boehm’s Spiral model or a combination of all. These models are currently used by most industries despite their limitations and bottlenecks. They do not address all the stages of Product Development Process, and this does not allow the company to tailor the process to fit their needs in all aspects of the development process. I have combined the principles of these three models and developed the 3D Hybrid Model with the aim to help industries overcome some or most of the limitations and bottlenecks faced during a NPD process.

I would appreciate your feedback on the 3D Hybrid Model I have developed. Could you please provide your inputs by completing the survey by clicking the  link: <i> <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdryTqWDb_yZoZZ_x3VYVIZtsZjAdg6PBkJAa-oJbCGrwipjQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">survey</a>.</i> Please base your response on your work experience and your industrial requirements. The survey contains a brief explanation of the 3D hybrid model with examples followed by questions. These questions are a mixture of multiple choice and open ended questions and the survey should take you about 25-30 minutes to complete. I am grateful for your time and support.
